# Single-pod Helm chart

## Status

provisional

## Summary

Provide a Helm chart to deploy Metal3 and Ironic as a single
pod in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Motivation

### Goals

The goal is to support a popular way to deploy Kubernetes applications
to simplify creation of development environments on top of arbitrary
Kubernetes clusters.

Another goal to prepare to set a standard for production-grade deployment
of Metal3 and its components.

### Non-Goals

Providing end-to-end bootstrap sequence for Metal3 and Ironic is not a
a goal of this design.

## Proposal

### User Stories

#### Story 1

As a user of Metal3, I want to install it in my existing Kubernetes
cluster using Helm.

### Implementation Details/Notes/Constraints

Initial implementation includes a Helm chart that creates single
pod deployment with Metal3 and Ironic components containers
in a Kubernetes cluster.

The charts shall be added as a separate repository in metal3-io space.
Proposed name for the repository is ``metal3-helm-chart``.

### Risks and Mitigations

None.

## Design Details

Helm charts will require a separate repository (metal3-helm-charts)
to be created.

In future, a CI environment that will build and test the charts,
will have to be created.

Potentially, the Helm charts will require changes in the way the
Docker images for components of Ironic and Metal3 are built. The
changes will include additional parameters that will be exposed
through the charts metadata (values.yaml files).

### Work Items

1. Create a Helm chart for Ironic and its components:

   - `ironic`
   - `ironic-dnsmasq`
   - `ironic-httpd`
   - `mariadb`
   - `baremetal-operator`

2. Create a CI for building the Helm chart and smoke verification.
3. Create a CI for testing Helm chart deployment and functional
   testing.

### Dependencies

- The charts require ``helm`` binary to build and deploy.
- Supported version of Helm is embedded in the charts.

The following repository is used as a bootstrap for adding
the chart to ``metal3-io/`` Github organization:

`https://github.com/Mirantis/metal3-helm-chart`

### Test Plan

Testing strategy for Helm charts includes static code tests and
integration tests. Integration tests include verification of
deployment, update/upgrade and functional verification of the
resulting installation for both scenarios.

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

None.

### Version Skew Strategy

None.

## Drawbacks

Helm charts do not immediately improve development environment
creation experience.

## Alternatives

Currently, the deployment functionality is already implemented as
``metal3-dev-env`` scripts. Another alternative is to use plain
Kubernetes manifest from ```baremetal-operator/deploy`` for
deployment on K8s.

## References

None.

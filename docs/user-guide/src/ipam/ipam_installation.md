# Installing IPAM as Deployment

This section will show how  IPAM can be installed as a deployment in a cluster.

## Deploying controllers

CAPI and IPAM controllers need to be deployed at the beginning. The IPAM controller has a dependency on Cluster API *Cluster* objects. CAPI CRDs and controllers must be deployed and the cluster objects should exist for successful deployments.

## Deployment

The user can create the **IPPool** object independently. It will wait for its cluster to exist before reconciling. If the user wants to create **IPAddress** objects manually, they should be created before any claims. It is highly recommended to use the *preAllocations* field itself or have the reconciliation paused.

After an **IPClaim** object creation, the controller will list all existing **IPAddress** objects. It will then select randomly an address that has not been allocated yet and is not in the *preAllocations* map. It will then create an **IPAddress** object containing the references to the **IPPool** and **IPClaim** and the address, the prefix from the address pool or the default prefix, and the gateway from the address pool or the default gateway.

### Deploy IPAM

Deploys IPAM CRDs and IPAM controllers. We can run Makefile target from inside the cloned IPAM git repo.

```sh
    make deploy
```

### Run locally

Runs IPAM controller locally

```sh
    kubectl scale -n capm3-system deployment.v1.apps/metal3-ipam-controller-manager \
      --replicas 0
    make run
```

### Deploy an example pool

```sh
    make deploy-examples
```

### Delete the example pool

```sh
    make delete-examples
```

## Deletion

When deleting an **IPClaim** object, the controller will simply delete the associated **IPAddress** object. Once all **IPAddress** objects have been deleted, the **IPPool** object can be deleted. Before that point, the finalizer in the **IPPool** object will block the deletion.

# Supported release versions

The Cluster API Provider Metal3 (CAPM3) team maintains the two most recent minor
releases; older minor releases are immediately unsupported when a new
major/minor release is available. Test coverage will be maintained for all
supported minor releases and for one additional release for the current API
version in case we have to do an emergency patch release. For example, if v1.4
and v1.5 are currently supported, we will also maintain test coverage for
v1.3 for one additional release cycle. When v1.6 is released, tests for v1.3
will be removed.

Currently, in Metal続 organization only CAPM3 and IPAM follow CAPI release
cycles. The supported versions (excluding release candidates) for CAPM3 and
IPAM releases are as follows:

Cluster API Provider Metal3

| Minor release | API version | Status    |
| ------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| v1.5          | v1beta1     | Supported |
| v1.4          | v1beta1     | Supported |
| v1.3          | v1beta1     | Tested    |
| v1.2          | v1beta1     | EOL       |
| v1.1          | v1beta1     | EOL       |

IP Address Manager

| Minor release | API version | Status    |
| ------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| v1.5          | v1beta1     | Supported |
| v1.4          | v1beta1     | Supported |
| v1.3          | v1beta1     | Tested    |
| v1.2          | v1alpha1    | EOL       |
| v1.1          | v1alpha1    | EOL       |

The compatability of IPAM and CAPM3 API versions with CAPI is discussed
[here](https://github.com/metal3-io/ip-address-manager#compatibility-with-cluster-api).

## Baremetal Operator

Since `capm3-v1.1.2`, BMO follows the semantic versioning scheme for its own
release cycle, the same way as CAPM3 and IPAM. Currently, we have release-0.4
and release-0.3 release branches for `v0.4.x` and `v0.3.x` release cycle
respectively and as such these two braches are maintained as supported releases.
Following table summarizes BMO release/test process:

| Minor release | Status    |
| ------------- | --------- |
| v0.4          | Supported |
| v0.3          | Tested    |
| v0.2          | Tested    |
| v0.1          | EOL       |

## Image tags

The Metal続 team provides container images for all the main projects and also
many auxilary tools needed for tests or otherwise useful. Some of these images
are tagged in a way that makes it easy to identify what version of Cluster API
provider Metal続 they are tested with. For example, we tag Ironic and MariaDB
container images with tags like `capm3-v1.4.0`, where `v1.4.0` would be the
CAPM3 release it was tested with. Prior to CAPM3 release v1.1.3 this also
applied to the Baremetal Operator.

All container images are published through the
[Metal続 organization in Quay](https://quay.io/organization/metal3-io).
Here are some examples:

- quay.io/metal3-io/cluster-api-provider-metal3:v1.5.0
- quay.io/metal3-io/baremetal-operator:v0.4.0
- quay.io/metal3-io/ip-address-manager:v1.5.0
- quay.io/metal3-io/ironic:capm3-v1.5.0
- quay.io/metal3-io/mariadb:capm3-v1.5.0

# Metal3 Presentations

<!-- cSpell:ignore revealjs,decktape -->

## Goal

The motivation behind this initiative is to provide easy to use presentation
templates for Metal3 projects, which can then be imported and built-upon to
create presentation for Meetups, Conferences or any other platforms. This can
serve as a supplement to existing documentation for new users, and also help
spread the project by helping presenters save time and focus on their content.

## Framework

We are using the [RevealJS](https://revealjs.com/) framework to create the
presentation. To contribute a presentation please create a directory, at the
`meta3-docs/docs/presentations` path, with your files associated with the
presentation, for example :-

```bash
ls metal3-docs/docs/presentations/test-presentation
test-image1.png  test-image2-capi.png test-presentation.html
```

To test your presentation with the revealjs framework, there are two simple
options:

1. Copy the `dist` and `plugin` directories from revealjs repository to the presentations directory.
2. Copy all the presentation files under the revealjs repository and open the presentation `.html` file inside a browser.

Here is an example :

```bash

## Clone revealjs repository
git clone https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js.git

## Option 1
cd ${your_presentation_directory}
cp -r ${revealjs_directory}/plugin .
cp -r ${revealjs_directory}/dist .

## Option 2
cp ${your_presentation_directory}/* ${revealjs_directory}

```

For full scale revealjs deployment refer
[here](https://revealjs.com/installation/#full-setup)

Now you can simply edit the presentation html, markdown files(when using an
external markdown file) to build on top of the presentation.

For exporting the presentation in pdf format, you can use
[decktape](https://github.com/astefanutti/decktape#install), for example :

```bash
decktape reveal test-presentation.html test_deck.pdf
```

Exporting to .odp or .pptx formats is not supported but
this [issue](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/1702) might help.

## Example

Lets see this example of the `metal3-overview` presentation.
First, let's see the list of files under the `metal3-overview` directory :

```diff
tree metal3-overview/

metal3-overview/
├── metal3-components.png
├── metal3-integration-capi.png
├── metal3-overview.html
├── slide-example-1.png
├── slide-example-2.png
└── slide-example-3.png
```

*`metal3-overview.html`* : is rendered with revealjs to create the slides, also
contains the markdown content inline
*`metal3 .png files`* : images that we created to be used in the slides
*`slide .png files`* : snapshots of a few slides in the presentation

In this example we have used an inline markdown for slides' content via
`<section data-markdown>`, but we can also include
that externally by specifying the external file like
`<section data-markdown="metal3-overview-slides.md">`.There are variety of
features available in the revealjs framework, for detailed documentation visit
[revealjs official website](https://revealjs.com/).

# Deployment of Metal3 on vanilla K8s cluster

To deploy metal3-components on vanilla K8s cluster, the following prerequisites
have to be met:

1. **Ironic should have access to layer-2 network for provisioning.**
2. **Firewall is configured properly**
3. **Webserver container containing  node images is running and reachable**
4. **Ironic-bmo-configmap is populated correctly**

We elaborate these points in detail here:

1. Ironic should have access to layer-2 network for provisioning. It
   should be running on **host** networking. And on top of that the
   network should be configured so that nodes can reach the networking
   service for DHCP, PXE boot .  It is also required to provide ironic
   with the MAC address(es) of each node that ironic is provisioning
   so that it can determine from which host the introspection data is
   coming from.

2. Firewall should be configured to allow the required traffic to pass
   through.  The following traffic should be allowed at least:
   - ARP
   - DHCP
   - VRRP
   - ICMP
   - HTTP towards internal and external webserver
   - Ports for the above mentioned services and for `Ironic-IPA`.
     The list of default ironic-ports are as follows:

      - 6180 --> for httpd webserver
      - 5050 --> for ironic-inspector
      - 6385 --> for ironic-endpoint
      - 9999 --> for ironic-ipa

3. The webserver container containing node images volume should be
   running and reachable. It is called the `httpd-infra` container in
   metal3-dev-env, which runs on ironic image and contains the node
   images (OS images). It also caches a few other packages which are
   required for the second webserver `ironic-httpd` which runs inside
   the cluster in `Baremetal Operator` deployment. The following tree
   structure shows an example of the volume mounted in the external
   webserver container with the required node images and other cached
   images:

   ```ini
   /shared/

   │   ├── inspector.ipxe
   │   └── uefi_esp.img
   └── tmp
   ```

4. The environments variables defined in `ironic-bmo-configmap`
   required for `Baremetal Operator` deployment needs to be defined
   prior to deploying the provider components in management cluster:

```sh
  PROVISIONING_IP=$CLUSTER_PROVISIONING_IP
  PROVISIONING_INTERFACE=$CLUSTER_PROVISIONING_INTERFACE
  PROVISIONING_CIDR=$PROVISIONING_CIDR
  DHCP_RANGE=$CLUSTER_DHCP_RANGE
  DEPLOY_KERNEL_URL=http://$CLUSTER_URL_HOST:6180/images/ironic-python-agent.kernel
  DEPLOY_RAMDISK_URL=http://$CLUSTER_URL_HOST:6180/images/ironic-python-agent.initramfs
  IRONIC_ENDPOINT=http://$CLUSTER_URL_HOST:6385/v1/
  IRONIC_INSPECTOR_ENDPOINT=http://$CLUSTER_URL_HOST:5050/v1/
  CACHEURL=http://$PROVISIONING_URL_HOST/images
```

This is an example representation of the environment variables which are
expected in `Baremetal Operator` deployment. This example actually shows the
environment variables also which are used in `metal3-dev-env` to populate the
configmap. This can be replaced by any variables in vanilla K8s cluster. It is
only important that the configmap variables are populated correctly so that
the ironic environment is reachable. In case, ironic is to be deployed locally,
these configmap env variables are populated through `ironic_ci.env` which
resides in `baremetal-operator/deploy/` folder.
